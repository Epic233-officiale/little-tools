# little-tools
so basically, this repositry doesn't have any real purpose. i am a beginner and all of my stuff are not really scaled, so if i find anything i make useful i will post it here. maybe you will make use of it, maybe not, or maybe you wanna change it, its up to you.

if you see those titles that are just jumbles of letters, i keysmashed it. probably because i was saving the project in a hurry or its not done yet.

if you are a mac user, some python scripts will not work as intended, i will try to fix that whenever i get to some macbook of my classmates.
